        <li><strong>Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</strong>
            <ul type="disc">
                <br>
                <li>No. HTML elements are defined by a starting tag, may contain some content and a closing tag.For example, &lt;h1&gt;Heading 1&lt;h1&gt; is a HTML element but just &lt;h1&gt; is a starting tag and &lt;h1&gt; is a closing tag.</li>

        <li><strong> What are tags and attributes in HTML?</strong>
            <ul type="disc">
                <br>
                <li>Tags are the primary component of the HTML that defines how the content will be structured/ formatted, whereas Attributes are used along with the HTML tags to define the characteristics of the element. For example, &lt;p align=” center”&gt;Interview questions&lt;/p&gt;, in this the ‘align’ is the attribute using which we will align the paragraph to show in the center of the view.

                    <li>HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be closed are Void elements. For Example &lt;br /&gt;, &lt;img /&gt;, &lt;hr /&gt;, etc.

                        <li>In HTML some characters are reserved like ‘<’, ‘>’, ‘/’, etc. To use these characters in our webpage we need to use the character entities called HTML Entities. Below are a few mapping between the reserved character and its respective entity character to be used.

                                A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.
                                
                                The &lt;dl&gt; tag defines the description list, the &lt;dt&gt; tag defines the term (name), and the &lt;dd&gt; tag describes each term:</p>

                        &lt;b&gt; - makes text bold

                        <li>To make a hyperlink in an HTML page, use the &lt;a&gt; and &lt;/a&gt; tags, which are the tags used to define the links. The &lt;a&gt; tag indicates where the hyperlink starts and the &lt;/a&gt; tag indicates where it ends. Whatever text gets added inside these tags, will work as a hyperlink. Add the URL for the link in the &lt;a href=” ”&gt;.

                                <li>The &lt;span&gt; tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The &lt;span&gt; tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The &lt;span&gt; tag is much like the &lt;div&gt; element, but &lt;div&gt; is a block-level element and &lt;span&gt; is an inline element.

                                <li>The most common & simple way to add background image is using the background image attribute inside the &lt;body&gt; tag.

                                            A link becomes active when you click on it. Tip: The :active selector can be used on all elements, not only links. Tip: Use the :link selector to style links to unvisited pages, the :visited selector to style links to visited pages, and the :hover selector to style links when you mouse over them.
